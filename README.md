# HealthBar

# Overview

The following code was designed for a health bar for the game that is being developed. I am looking forward to increasing my knowledge from this experience to get better with the C# programming. 

The following software was designed to control the health of the game's character. At the start of the round he will have a maximum health of 100 and his health would decrease every time he receives damage.

The purpose for this work was to get to know better in terms of game programming.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

The tools I've been using were Visual Code and Unity. Unity itself has been used by numerous game developers to create various games and Visual Code is one of the apps that are well suited for applying the program for those games. The programming language I relied on was c#.

# Future Work

- I'm planning on applying a gradient that would change the color of the filling depending on how much health the player has
